                The Australian Football League (AFL) is the pre-eminent professional competition in the sport of
                Australian rules football in Australia and features only Australian teams. Through the AFL Commission,
                the AFL also serves as the sport's governing body, and is responsible for controlling the laws of the
                game.

                The league currently consists of 18 teams spread over five of Australia's six states (Tasmania being the
                exception). Matches have been played in all mainland states and territories of Australia, as well as in
                New Zealand and China (although no professional teams or leagues exist outside Australia) to promote the
                sport abroad. The AFL season currently consists of a pre-season competition (currently branded as the
                "JLT Community Series"), followed by a 23-round regular (or "home-and-away") season, which runs during
                the Australian winter (March to September). The top eight teams then play off in a four-round finals
                series, culminating in the AFL Grand Final, which is held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground each year. The
                grand final winner is termed the "premiers", and is awarded the premiership cup. The current premiers
                are the Richmond Football Club.

            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p style="font-family: courier;font-size: 15px;">
                The motivation behind taking up this project is too encourage more kids to engage with Australian Football. According to the 2017 AFL annual report school football has seen a rise in participation by 16.21%. This shows that there is a scope to engage more school kids into the sport.

                We believe that the kids will be actively participating in AFL if we introduce gamification. So, we have introduced the concept of Kids Footy League (KFL) which is the kids’ version of AFL fantasy league. The idea is to build a web-based platform that lets users register (under parents’ guidance) and form their profile. Using this profile each user can select 5 players for their fantasy team each week from a list of players. Once the matches are done, users can see how their active players performed and get a score based on that. The leader board mechanism is also incorporated so that kids can compete for the top spot.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p style="font-family: courier;font-size: 15px;">

                AFL-Almanac project is about creating a commercially viable product that promotes to engage more audiences between the ages of 5-12 year olds in the AFL (Australian Football League). This involves promoting AFL by creating a video library with the large archive of match/event with the existing footage. Moreover, adding a fantasy league game for the children in which they can achieve points by creating their own team. Children can also get points by watching videos and answering quizzes based on those videos. Having a leaderboard in which the children will be ranked based on their points and the top 3 children in the leaderboard will get rewarded at the end of the season would certainly attract more kids in the sport.
